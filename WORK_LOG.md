# NRC7292 Analysis Work Log

## Project Overview
- **Project**: NRC7292 HaLow Driver Code Analysis
- **Repository**: https://github.com/oyongjoo/nrc7292-analysis
- **Purpose**: Learn and document NRC7292 Linux kernel driver architecture

## Git Configuration
- **User**: Liam Lee <oyongjoo@gmail.com>
- **Repository**: oyongjoo/nrc7292-analysis
- **Branch**: master

## Completed Tasks

### 2025-06-15 - Initial Setup
1. âœ… **Git Repository Setup**
   - Created GitHub repository: https://github.com/oyongjoo/nrc7292-analysis
   - Configured git user: Liam Lee <oyongjoo@gmail.com>
   - Initial commit with code analysis documentation

2. âœ… **Initial Documentation Structure**
   - Created `code_analysis/README.md` - Main documentation overview
   - Created `code_analysis/architecture/overview.md` - Basic architecture overview
   - Created `code_analysis/driver_components/board_data.md` - Board data analysis
   - Created `code_analysis/notes/initial_findings.md` - Initial analysis findings
   - Created `code_analysis/regulatory/country_codes.md` - Regulatory compliance analysis

3. âœ… **Project Structure Analysis**
   - Analyzed NRC7292 software package structure
   - Identified main components: kernel driver, CLI app, EVK scripts
   - Created CLAUDE.md with project guidance

## Current Session Tasks

### Architecture Analysis (In Progress)
1. ðŸ”„ **Detailed Architecture Documentation**
   - Analyzing driver source files in `nrc7292_sw_pkg/package/src/nrc/`
   - Mapping component interactions and data flow
   - Documenting layer-by-layer architecture

2. ðŸ“‹ **Pending Architecture Tasks**
   - [ ] Create detailed component interaction diagrams
   - [ ] Document data flow and communication paths  
   - [ ] Analyze driver initialization sequence
   - [ ] Document power management architecture

## Next Steps
1. Complete detailed architecture analysis
2. Analyze WIM protocol implementation
3. Study power management mechanisms
4. Examine mesh networking support
5. Review testing framework

## Key Files and Locations
- **Main Driver Source**: `/home/liam/work/nrc7292_sw_pkg/package/src/nrc/`
- **CLI Application**: `/home/liam/work/nrc7292_sw_pkg/package/src/cli_app/`
- **Documentation**: `/home/liam/work/code_analysis/`
- **Project Instructions**: `/home/liam/work/CLAUDE.md`

## Build Commands Reference
```bash
# Kernel Driver
cd package/src/nrc && make clean && make

# CLI Application  
cd package/src/cli_app && make clean && make

# Testing
cd package/src/nrc/test/block_ack && python testsuit.py
```

## Important Notes
- Always commit with Co-Authored-By: Liam Lee <oyongjoo@gmail.com>
- Focus on learning NRC7292 HaLow driver architecture
- Maintain detailed documentation for future reference
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones

## Session Context
- Working on detailed architecture analysis after initial setup
- User requested work_log to maintain continuity between Claude sessions
- Current focus: Understanding driver component interactions and data flow
