## Analysis Objectives

1. **Driver Architecture Understanding**
   - Integration with Linux mac80211 framework
   - HIF (Hardware Interface) layer structure
   - WIM (Wireless Interface Module) protocol

2. **HaLow Technology Characteristics**
   - Sub-1GHz operation principles
   - Power management mechanisms
   - Mesh networking support

3. **Regulatory Compliance by Country**
   - Channel plan analysis by country
   - Power limits and board data
   - Special requirements (LBT, MIC, etc.)

4. **Code Quality and Maintainability**
   - Kernel version compatibility
   - Error handling patterns
   - Test coverage

## Getting Started

Analyze code in each subdirectory and create learning materials for the respective areas.
